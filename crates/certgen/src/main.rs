//! Writes the internal-TLS certificate bundle. Run from the workspace root:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p rustibia-certgen
//! ```
//!
//! Both processes default to reading `certs/` relative to their own working directory,
//! so from `crates/site` or `crates/server` pass the path explicitly:
//! `cargo run -p rustibia-certgen -- ../../certs`.
//!
//! Regenerating invalidates nothing but itself — no certificate here is trusted by
//! anything outside this repository — but it does require restarting both processes,
//! since each loads its files once at boot.
